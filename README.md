A Python implementation that solves the N-Queens problem using CSP, making it adaptable to various sizes of the chessboard.
Utilizes the chess Python library to visualize the board and queen placements for solutions. This makes it easier to understand and appreciate the solutions. 
(Note that the visualization only works for n <= 8.  For larger n, solutions will be printed in a text-based format.
